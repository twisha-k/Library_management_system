This is a Library Management system mini project.

Working of the program :-
- First when the program runs it will ask you to choose from the list of operation you can perform throught this program.
- You choose either add book,remove book or show the list of books that were added to the library system through option [1] (add book).
- The code will not run properly or will show error if you try to remove a book without adding any books in the system first.
- So make sure to add the book first and then either remove or display the list of books.
